Query/Response UI
=================

**WIP: Driving the goals and implementation of the UI with this README, please
       feel free to provide feedback and ideas through issues.**

The Query/Response UI helps you gain insights and observe your service
landscape by providing rich information about how queries and responses are
flowing through the system.

Getting started
---------------

The Query/Response UI joins the messaging network, and is _eating its own dog
food_ by using queries to gather information about the current system.

The simplest way to start the UI is to run it locally using `make`, or start
the Spring BootÂ® application by running `mvn spring-boot:run`. The
Query/Response UI application is served at http://localhost:8080 by default.

> The default Spring AMQP configuration will attempt to connect to a local
> broker on port 5672 with `guest/guest`. To use another RabbitMQ or other
> credentials you can provide the command line arguments:
> 
> * `-Dspring.rabbitmq.host=hostname`
> * `-Dspring.rabbitmq.username=user`
> * `-Dspring.rabbitmq.password=password`
> 
> Or set the environment variables:
> 
> * `SPRING_RABBITMQ_HOST`
> * `SPRING_RABBITMQ_USERNAME`
> * `SPRING_RABBITMQ_PASSWORD`.

Developing
----------

The Query/Response UI is mostly a _thick client_ or Single Page Application
SPA. However, at the time of writing, it is built using HTML, CSS and ES6 JS.
To access the client you can use the `make dev` target, and browse to
http://localhost:3000. The resources are in `src/main/resources/public`.

Happy hacking!
