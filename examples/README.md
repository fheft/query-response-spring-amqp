Query/Response Examples
=======================

In order to show how the Query/Response API works, and provide developers with
a setup to get some hands-on experience, we've provided a small example setup.

Running the examples
--------------------

1. Make sure to open both the `querying/` and `responding/` directories in a
   terminal window, next to each other.

2. Each of the example _sides_ can be started by simply running `make`. And will
   end by pressing `CTRL-C`.
